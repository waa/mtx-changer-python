# If you have more than one tape library managed by your

# to manage the specific settings for each of them using
# the '-s section' command line option to reference a
# specific configuration override [section] in this file.
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the DEFAULT section. If no '-s section' is specififed on
# the command line, only the settings in this section will be used.
# Use custom [sections] to override any setting in the DEFAULT section.
