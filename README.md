# mtx-changer-python.py
- A drop-in replacement for Bacula's original bash/perl `mtx-changer` script to control tape libraries, with additional features:
  - Clear logging of actions when 'debug_level' != 0
  - Control what information gets logged by setting the 'debug_level' variable
  - Automatic tape drive cleaning.
    - Can be configured to check a drive's `sg_logs` status after an unload, automatically find and load a cleaning tape, wait, then unload it

Please edit the `mtx-changer-python.conf` configuration file to customize what (if anything) gets logged to the debug log file, and to set other custom variables for the library or libraries managed by the SD.

This mtx-changer-python.py script is meant to be called by the Bacula Storage daemon (SD) to load/unload drives in a tape library, transfer tapes to another slot, or to issue queries to the library to get information about volumes loaded in drives and slots.

To use the mtx-changer-python.py script with an autochanger, it must be configured in the Bacula SD's Autochanger `ChangerCommand` setting like:
```
Autochanger {
  Name = AutochangerName
  Description = "Autochanger with four drives"
  ChangerDevice = "/dev/tape/by-id/scsi-XXXXXXXXXX"
  ChangerCommand = "/opt/bacula/scripts/mtx-changer-python.py %c %o %S %a %d"    <---- Here
  Device = Drive_0, Drive_1, Drive_2, Drive_3
}
```

Where the variables passed to the mtx-changer-python.py script by the Bacula SD are:
```
%c           - Library's changer device node. eg: /dev/tape/by-id/scsi-XXXXXXXXXX, or /dev/sgX
%o           - The command. Valid options: slots, list, listall, loaded, load, unload, transfer.
%S           - The one-based library slot to load/unload, or the source slot for the transfer command.
%a           - The drive's "ArchiveDevice". eg: /dev/nst#, or /dev/tape/by-id/*-nst, or /dev/tape/by-path/* node.
               Or, the destination slot for the transfer command.
%d           - The zero-based drive index.
```

Optional command line parameters:
```
-c <config>  - Configuration file. [default: /opt/bacula/scripts/mtx-changer-python.conf]
-s <section> - Section in configuration file. [default: DEFAULT]
-i %i        - Optional jobid. If present, it will be written to the log file after the timestamp.
-j %j        - Optional job name. If present, it will be written to the log file after the jobid.
```

Instructions on which parameters are optional, which are required, and the order they must appear in are all described at the top of the mtx-changer-python.py script. Please read that first.

Command line parameter use:

### Example command lines and outputs:

- `slots` Prints the number of slots to stdout:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py /dev/chgr0 slots X Y Z
44
```
The slots command does not use the slot, drive device, nor drive index (X, Y, Z), but they must be present.

- `list` will return a list of FULL slots in the format 'slot:volume' like this:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py /dev/chgr0 list X Y Z

The list command does not use the slot, drive device, nor drive index (X, Y, Z), but they must be present.

- `listall` will return a list of all slots in the library in different formats depending on whether the location represents a Drive, a Slot, or an Input/Output location, and whether it is full or empty:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py /dev/chgr0 listall X Y Z

The listall command does not use the slot, drive device, nor drive index (X, Y, Z), but they must be present.

- `load` and `unload` commands do not output anything to stdout except on error, which will be printed in the joblog by the SD. On successful load/unload of a tape from a slot to/from a drive, the script simply exits with return code 0, else the return code is 1.

In this example, we load a tape from slot 30 into drive 1 and then unload it:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py /root/chgr80 load 30 /dev/tape/by-id/scsi-350223344ab001000-nst 1
# echo $?
0

# ./mtx-changer-python.py /root/chgr80 unload 30 /dev/tape/by-id/scsi-350223344ab001000-nst 1
# echo $?
0
```

- `loaded` will return the slot of the tape that is loaded in the drive, or zero (0) if the drive is empty.

Here we see that drive 0 is empty, and drive 1 is loaded with a tape from slot 30:
```
./mtx-changer-python.py /root/chgr80 loaded X Y 0  # Drive index 0 is empty.
0

./mtx-changer-python.py /root/chgr80 loaded X Y 1  # Drive index 1 is loaded with a tape from slot 30
30
```
The loaded command does not use the slot and drive device parameters (X, Y) but they must be present.

- `transfer` will attempt to transfer a tape from one slot to another.

The transfer command does not output anything to stdout except on error, which will be printed in the joblog by the SD. On successful transfer of a tape from one slot to another, the script simply exits with return code 0, or it will exit with return code 1 on a failure.

Here we attempt to transfer a full slot (31) to an empty slot (29) and the command is successful:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py -c ./mtx-changer-python.conf /root/chgr80 transfer 31 29 X
# echo $?
0
```

Here we attempt to transfer a now empty slot (31) to a now full slot (29) and the command fails. Notice we have the failure reason printed to stdout. This will be printed in the joblog by the SD:
```
# ./mtx-changer-python.py -c ./mtx-changer-python.conf /root/chgr80 transfer 29 31 X
Err: The source slot is empty, or the destination slot is full. Will not even attempt the transfer
# echo $?
1
```
The transfer command uses the drive device parameter as the destination slot, and does not use the drive index (X), but it must be present.
